# nasa-project
full-stack project 

this is my full stack project ( focus on backend ) , 
check package.json in root directory to start project on your localhost. 

1 - npm run install

2 -npm run deploy-cluster

I used mongoDB for database of this project also you can see kepler_names in first page of project from database (fetch data from db first and then laucnh website)

I used PM2 there for handle requests so run npm deploy cluster to to check it .
